      "Below are the criticisms on it:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Provide a Clear Objective**: Start the hint by explicitly stating the goal: \"You need to measure exactly 3L of water using the 4L and 2L buckets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Encourage Logical Thinking**: Suggest breaking down the problem into smaller steps. For instance: \"Consider the sequence of filling, pouring, and emptying each bucket as distinct steps that contribute to reaching the target of 3L.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Promote Experimentation**: Encourage the user to think through different possibilities, such as starting with either bucket. For example: \"Try different combinations of filling and pouring from both buckets to experiment with how to reach exactly 3L.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add Intermediate Steps Guidance**: Offer a clue or prompt for common actions, like: \"Think about how you can use the smaller bucket to measure out water from the larger bucket, while keeping track of the total volume you've manipulated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Highlight the Use of Process of Elimination**: Suggest that the user may need to empty one or both buckets at certain points to ensure they can reach the desired volume: \"Consider how emptying buckets at strategic points can help you manipulate the volumes you have available.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Emphasize Verification**: Remind the user to verify the amounts in both buckets after each step to ensure they are making progress towards the final goal: \"Keep track of how much water is in each bucket after each action to confirm if you are nearing 3L.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Reinforce Step-by-Step Approach**: Encourage the use of a systematic approach by asking, \"What is the result of each action you take? List them out as you go to ensure you are not missing any steps.\"\n",

      "   - Pour into the 2L bucket until it is full, which will leave exactly 3L in the 4L bucket.\n",
